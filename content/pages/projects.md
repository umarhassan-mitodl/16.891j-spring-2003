A Strategy for the Development of a Reusable Launch Vehicle
-----------------------------------------------------------

### Background

The Shuttle was developed in the late sixties. It's operational life can take it through 2025. Many have called for NASA to develop a new reusable launch vehicle that will substantially reduce the cost of launch to orbit. However, this has been tried before with a great deal of money spent before the project was cancelled (X-33). This project will develop the strategies to develop a new reusable launch vehicle in the 2025 timeframe.

### Products

1.  A publishable, scholarly research paper. _Due: Lec #12_.
2.  A detailed outline of the research paper. _Due: Lec #8_.
3.  A bibliography of all sources consulted. _Due: Lec #9_.
4.  A presentation for the class that summarizes the research paper and leads the group in a scholarly discussion of the issue. _Due: Lec #11_.
5.  A set of readings to be distributed to all visitors, to provide them with background. _Due: 1 week prior to presentation_

### Charter

The project will accomplish the following tasks:

1.  Review past NASA and Air Force attempts to develop a reusable launch vehicle.
2.  Assess the possibilities for international cooperation in the development of such a vehicle.
3.  Determine the potential commercial viability of such a system.
4.  Study the potential NASA/Air Force joint requirements for such a vehicle.
5.  Propose (cost-effective) strategies for the development of such a vehicle.
